## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js (optional, for development tools)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-symptom-checker.git
   cd healthcare-symptom-checker
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

### 3. Result Actions

- **Save Results**: Store analysis for future reference
- **Check New Symptoms**: Reset form for new analysis
- **Export**: Download results as PDF (future feature)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_DEBUG=True
FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0
FLASK_PORT=5000

# Database Configuration (if using database)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/healthcare_db

# API Keys (for external services)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MEDICAL_API_KEY=your_medical_api_key

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### Backend Configuration

Modify `app.py` for custom settings:

```python
# CORS origins
CORS(app, origins=["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"])

# Logging level
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Server configuration
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

## üß† Symptom Analysis Engine

### How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: Natural language processing of symptom descriptions
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of symptom patterns and combinations
3. **Medical Knowledge Base**: Matching symptoms against comprehensive medical database
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of urgency and risk factors
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Personalized health advice and actions

### Medical Categories Covered

- **Respiratory**: Cold, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma
- **Gastrointestinal**: Food poisoning, gastritis, gastroenteritis, IBS
